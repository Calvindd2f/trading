ML Feature Enhancements:

Anomaly Detection Algorithms:
Experiment with different anomaly detection algorithms, such as One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest, to improve the accuracy of pump and dump detection.
Consider using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple algorithms.
Feature Engineering:
Extract more features from the historical data, such as:
Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator)
Sentiment analysis from social media and news outlets
Order book data (e.g., bid-ask spread, order flow)
Use feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, mutual information) to identify the most relevant features for the model.
Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experiment with different machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, to find the best performing model for the task.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to optimize the model's performance.
Walk-Forward Optimization:
Implement walk-forward optimization to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly.
Usability Enhancements:

Web Interface:
Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTMX and Flask to visualize the trading bot's performance, including:
Real-time charts of cryptocurrency prices and trading activity
Performance metrics (e.g., profit/loss, trade count, equity curve)
Configuration options for the trading bot (e.g., risk management, trade size)
Logging and Monitoring:
Implement a more comprehensive logging system to track the trading bot's activity, including:
Trade executions and their outcomes
Model predictions and accuracy metrics
System errors and warnings
Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the system's performance and identify potential issues.
Configuration and Deployment:
Create a configuration file or database to store the trading bot's settings, making it easier to manage and deploy the system.
Develop a deployment script to automate the deployment process, including setting up the WebSocket connection and scheduling the trading bot.
Code Organization and Refactoring:

Modularize the Code:
Break down the main.py file into smaller, more manageable modules, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., data processing, model training, trading logic).
Use a consistent naming convention and follow best practices for code organization.
Error Handling and Testing:
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the system's correctness and reliability.
